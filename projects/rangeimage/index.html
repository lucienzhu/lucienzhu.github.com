        <p>This project is done during my undergraduate work.
    Based on the intelligent vehicle <a href="http://poss.pku.edu.cn">POSS</a>, I process range data from two range sensors (SICK LMS 200).</p>
    <p>The data can be represented as 3D point clouds combining the pose and location of the
    vehicle. Meanwhile, it can also be represented as range image due to the property of range
    sensor. Then a Computer Vision framework of image segmentation and classification is applied
    to this range image to give each point a semantic label. The whole data is processed offline.</p>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>As the rapid development of sensing and mapping techniques, it becomes a well-known technology that a map of complex environment can be generated using a robot carrying sensors. However, most of the existing researches represent envi- ronments directly using the integration of point clouds or other low-level geometric primitives. It remains an open problem to automatically convert these low-level map representations to semantic descriptions in order to effectively support high-level decision of a robot. Based on another representation of 3D point clouds, i.e. range image, this paper proposes a framework of segmentation and classification of range image, the objective of which is to annotate class labels to the data clusters that are obtained through a graph-based segmentation. Experimental results are presented and evaluated demonstrating that the pro- posed algorithm has efficiency in understanding the semantic knowledge of a large dynamic urban outdoor environment.
