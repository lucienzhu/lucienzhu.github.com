        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>In this paper, we introduce a novel method for depth ac- quisition based on refraction of light. A scene is captured twice by a fixed perspective camera, with the first image captured directly by the camera and the second by placing a transparent medium between the scene and the camera. A depth map of the scene is then recovered from the displace- ments of scene points in the images. Unlike other existing depth from refraction methods, our method does not require the knowledge of the pose and refractive index of the trans- parent medium, but can recover them directly from the in- put images. We hence call our method self-calibrating depth from refraction. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data are presented, which demonstrate the effec- tiveness of the proposed method.
